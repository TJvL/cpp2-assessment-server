This project assumes the Asio headers are in a standard include location on the operating system.
Tested in Ubuntu 20 where the Asio headers are located at /usr/include/asio.hpp and /usr/include/asio/*.

Unit tests are written using Catch2 (https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). It is added as a git submodule and should be pulled first when you want to run the unit tests.
